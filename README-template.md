## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox to position main element
- CSS Grid to position bottom section of element
- Colors, padding, spacing, etc.
- Desktop-first workflow
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

I am trying to keep things simple, and let the browser rules take care of as much of the styling as I can. The end result is not pixel perfect, but it maintains the main elements of the design. Let me know what you guys think? Were there some ways I could simplify this even more?



### Continued development

I want to continue to work on my ability to create simple, clean CSS which relies on browser rules. I also want to work on my ability to name things and keep things organized in ways that are intuitive.
